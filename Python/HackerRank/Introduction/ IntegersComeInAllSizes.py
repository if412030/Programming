""" Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is: 231−1231−1 (c++ int) or 263−1263−1 (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of abab grows really fast with increasing bb.

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

Task
Read four numbers, aa, bb, cc, and dd, and print the result of ab+cdab+cd.

Input Format
Integers aa, bb, cc, and dd are given on four separate lines, respectively.

Constraints
1≤a≤10001≤a≤1000
1≤b≤10001≤b≤1000
1≤c≤10001≤c≤1000
1≤d≤10001≤d≤1000

Output Format
Print the result of ab+cdab+cd on one line.

Sample Output

Note: This result is bigger than 263−1263−1. Hence, it won't fit in the long long int of C++ or a 64-bit integer.  """
